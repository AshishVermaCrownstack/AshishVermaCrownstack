### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Ashish Verma
#### Software Developer
I am a passionate budding engineer, open to challenges and keep to learn, enhancing and grasping skills, looking for opportunities, and most importantly have adaptation skills towards any role of job in my sector.
At school, I choose to lead at sports, part of the winning team at nationals in kabbadi. Choose to engineer to build and develop something that would really be significant to humankind. I have worked among teams at different levels, building communication skills, team management, and participating at college and inter colleges levels in coding fests and technical events. I led my team at paper presentation, building presentation skills, and developed a stock analysis program using machine learning.
Then worked as a student coordinator at my college annual fest focused on technical events. It helped to enhance leadership skills. I am enthusiastic about goals and open to challenges.
